HRAFNSM√ÅL
=========

Visualize a github organization's commits over the last 24 hours, broken down by repository, push and commit.

But, more than that, it's an excuse for me to poke around the github API and toy around with d3.js.

Largely based on on John Stasko's Sunburst design [http://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/ii/sunburst/], this demo has been cobbled together, inspired by various examples from the d3.js website.

Setup
-----

Update config.js with an OAuth token and the org's event API. Get a one-off token via:

    curl -i -u "username" -d '{"scopes":["repo"]}' https://api.github.com/authorizations

Run it.

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

How is it with you, ye ravens?
