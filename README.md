But, more than that, it's an excuse for me to poke around the github API and toy around with d3.js.

Largely based on on John Stasko's Sunburst design [http://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/ii/sunburst/], this demo has been cobbled together, inspired by various examples from the d3.js website.

It should be noted that my JS chops are less than stellar. Thusly, there are a few rough edges.
